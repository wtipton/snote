To get this working, have to:

- prevent wine from calling XGrabPointer when the game is fullscreen. to do
  this, had to comment out (or otherwise avoid) all calls in the wine sources
  and recompile.
  - the wine source that actually starts the game was made with pkgbuild from
    https://github.com/Tk-Glitch/PKGBUILDS/blob/master/wine-tkg-git/README.md
  - so start the build, let it extract stuff, pause it, edit, continue
  - in mouse.c:grab_clipping_window, a return TRUE at the beginning of the
    function to skip.
  - in window.c:X11DRV_SetCapture I just commented out the XGrabPointer call
  - dunno which was relevant.

- place our window over starcraft
  - hack openbox to put Above windows over Fullscreen. this 
    - in stacking.h, swap the two corresponding values in the enum
    - could possibly add another option value to the layer option and
      support it in config.c.
  - btw, a dead-end: use overrideredirect
    - redirectoverride windows can't get get focus by being clicked on
    - in Tk, there's a hack that does this:
      http://core.tcl.tk/tk/artifact/7892c68f49012d2d71222ae0e312a1e7dc69a801?txt=1&ln=51-64
      - so build the package, delete that code, and rebuild with makepkg -e
    - but apparently this behavior isn't just limited to Tk...

- wine for good performance
  - start with base tga config
  - enable FS_bypass_compositor (i.e. "protonified" i think)
  - enable dxvk

- allow Alt+dragging on the minimap
  - Had to get rid of mouse bindings Alt + left click, press, and drag in the
    openbox rc.xml. Changed to windows key.

TODAY:
- reorganize project directory into blaze+git
- refactor stuff into like a class or something
- display error status instead of just Loading...
- have 3 sizes
- display proto-based build orders

TODO:
- nice-to-have
  - pop notes window upwards so it doesn't cover the minimap.
  - auto un-decorate? this is just an openbox setting maybe.
  - "hide until gameover" button? Or just a pop-in to make it even smaller?
  - refactor into a class, get rid of globals, whatnot.
  - add (and upstream?) an openbox feature to layer above fullscreen.
  - try to XGrabPointer ourselves preemptively so we dont' ahve to hack wine?
    - or add a user patches into the custom wine tree at least
    - or change some params in the XGrabPointer call so that other windows
      still get events?
    - or put a fullscreen transparent overlay over the whole screen?
